This was a previous version of the assembler that was made in C++. It was
incomplete. I decided to switch to python after already starting on this project. I
was almost finished with the first pass of making the symbol table, just tweaking
some minor bugs before I abandoned this effort. For update information regarding the
project, please refer to the python version of the assembler's README.
